## Devlog
Romarick Anderson, He/Him (But i dont mind any others)

My teams plan for the minigame was pretty simplistic, as we only had bullet points of the nesseracy componets and GameObjects we need to complete the game, and my code had most of our listed elements within my minigame. However, some of our listed componets for the player and enviroment weren't required. For example, on our doccument, we noted that the player should contain a 2d rigidbody, but when i was finishing the code for teh minigame it really wasn't required to make the player move like the example, so i decided to not add the feature. Ultiamtely, me and my team had a good understanding of the rrequired elements needed within the game even with the unessarcy additions.
